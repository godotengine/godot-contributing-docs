How to contribute
=================

.. _doc_ways_to_contribute:

The Godot Engine is free and open-source. Like any community-driven project, we rely on volunteer contributions.

On this page we want to showcase the various ways you as users can participate - to help you find the right starting place with the skillset you have.
Because contrary to popular opinion, we need more than just programmers on the project!

You can also find ways to contribute by browsing the navigation bar on the left.
If you're on mobile, you may need to click the "navigation icon" on the top left of the page.

Fundraising
-----------

- **Donate**

  We created the non-profit `Godot Foundation <https://godot.foundation/>`_ to be able to support the Godot Engine in both matters of finance and administration.
  In practice, this means the Foundation hires people to work part-time or full-time on the project.
  These jobs include engine development as well as related tasks like code reviews, production management, community & marketing efforts, and more.

  With as little as 5 EUR per month, you can help us keep going strong.
  Currently, we are intending to hire more core developers, as to cover more ground with full-time specialists that supplement and guide volunteer work.

  `Join the Development Fund <https://fund.godotengine.org>`_

- **Donation Drives**
  Think about your followers on social media, or other communities you are active in.
  Use that reach to remind your social environment that even small contributions can make a difference, especially when done by a great number of people at the same time.

  Are you a content creator? Consider adding a link to the `Godot Development Fund <https://fund.godotengine.org>`_ to your descriptions.
  If you do live streams, perhaps think about organizing a stream with donation incentives.

Provide feedback
----------------

- **Report bugs & other issues**
  As active users of the engine, you are better equipped to identify bugs and other issues than anyone else.
  To let us know about your findings, fill out this `bug report form <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/new/choose>`_ on our GitHub.
  Make sure to include as much information as possible to ensure these issues can easily be reproduced by others.

- **Propose and discuss ideas**
  To meaningfully improve Godot, we first need the community to propose and discuss ideas to improve the engine.
  To get started, please visit our section on :ref:`sharing ideas and proposing changes <doc_contributing_ideas>`.

- **Test development versions**
  While it is recommended to use the stable releases for your projects, you can :ref:`help us test <doc_testing_development_versions>`
  dev releases, betas, and release candidates by opening a copy of your project in them and checking what problems this
  might introduce or maybe even solves. Make sure to have a backup ready, to avoid potential irreversible changes.

  Find recent `development versions <https://godotengine.org/download/preview/>`_ directly on our download page, or linked in their own blog posts.

- **Test and discuss pull requests**
  Every change to Godot starts with a pull request, and all pull requests need feedback.
  Even without knowing how to program, you can help by :ref:`testing whether pull requests work as intended <doc_testing_pull_requests>`,
  by discussing whether new features are useful and appropriate, and giving feedback on how to improve fixes or new features.

  You can start by browsing pull requests `directly on GitHub <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/pulls>`__,
  or by finding linked pull requests of `bug reports <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues>`__ and of
  `proposed changes <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues>`__.


Participate in Godot's development
----------------------------------

- **Engine code (mainly C++)**
  If you are a programmer, you can contribute to Godot by :ref:`working on its source code <doc_intro_to_engine_contributions>`.
  You can participate in almost every step of the :ref:`PR workflow <doc_pr_workflow>`! Most commonly, contributors
  fix bugs and make improvements by :ref:`opening pull requests <doc_creating_pull_requests>`.
  Once you start getting more proficient with Godot's codebase, we'd also greatly appreciate help in the
  :ref:`code review process <doc_pr_review_guidelines>`!

  The engine development is coordinated by :ref:`teams <doc_areas>` and discussed on the `Godot Contributors Chat <https://chat.godotengine.org/>`__.
  If you are serious about making PRs, you should join us there!

- **Documentation**
  The documentation is one of the most essential parts of any tech project, yet the need to document new features and substantial changes often gets overlooked.
  :ref:`Contribute documentation <doc_documentation_overview>` to improve the Godot Engine with your technical writing skills.

- **Translations (spoken languages other than English)**
  Are you interested in making the Godot Engine more accessible to non-English speakers?
  Contribute to our :ref:`community translations <doc_editor_and_docs_localization>` on
  `Weblate <https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/godot-engine/godot/>`__.

- **Bugsquad & triage**
  With so many bug reports and pull requests being opened each day, the :team:`Triage` — also called bugsquad — is
  invaluable to keep things organized.
  If you'd like to get involved, please visit :ref:`doc_bug_triage_intro`!

- **Contribute to other Godot resources**
  Besides the engine itself, you can contribute to many other aspects of Godot, such as the :ref:`website <doc_contributing_to_the_website>`,
  the :ref:`C++ GDExtension bindings <doc_godot_cpp>`, and our :ref:`development resources <doc_resources>`. Many of
  these non-engine resources are made with different technology from Godot itself, so they require people with
  different skill sets working on them!

  To find resources to contribute to, browse the navigation bar on the left (on mobile, click the menu button on the top
  left).


Contribute to Godot's ecosystem
-------------------------------

- **Publish Godot games.**
  You heard right, simply publishing a game #MadeWithGodot can positively impact the well-being of this project.
  Your personal success elevates the engine to a viable alternative for other developers, growing the community further.
  Additionally, it opens the door for us to approach industry contacts about possible collaborations.

- **Create and improve demo projects (GDScript, C#, and making assets)**
  We provide new users with `demo projects <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/>`_ so they can quickly test new features or get familiar with the engine in the first place.
  At industry events, we might even exhibit these demo projects to showcase what Godot can do!
  Help improve existing projects or write your own, and join the `demo channel <https://chat.godotengine.org/channel/demo-content>`_ in the Godot Contributors Chat to talk about it.

- **Write plugins (GDScript, C#, & more)**
  Community addons are not directly included in the core engine download or repository, yet they provide essential quality of life upgrades for your fellow game developers.
  Upload your plugins to the `Godot Asset Library <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ to make them available to others.

  ..
    update to talk about Asset Store later

- **Create tutorials & more**
  How did you get started with the Godot Engine?
  Chances are you looked for learning materials outside of what the official documentation provides.
  Without content creators covering the game development process, there would not be this big of a community today.
  We greatly appreciate every person who makes it their goal to teach others how to use Godot!


Help with community support
---------------------------

- **Call for Moderators**
  With a community of our size, we need people to step up as volunteer moderators in all kinds of places.
  These teams are organized by the Godot Foundation, but would not function without the dedication of active community members like you.

  Have a look around your favorite community platform and you might come across open application calls.

- **Answer tech-support questions**
  With many new people discovering the Godot Engine recently, the need for peer-to-peer tech-support has never been greater.
  See the `Godot website <https://godotengine.org/community>`_ for a list of official and user-supported Godot communities.
