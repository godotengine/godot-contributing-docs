General rules and guidelines
============================

This page contains guidelines relevant for contributing to any area of Godot.

When contributing to any particular area, please also refer to its respective guidelines.

Code of conduct
---------------

When you contribute to Godot, we expect that you respect our `Code of Conduct <https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Contributing with AI and large language models
----------------------------------------------

.. note:: When this page refers to "AI" it means any LLM/generative
          AI model like ChatGPT, Claude, Grok, etc., or any other
          models that fulfill the same role.

The use of AI to contribute to Godot is discouraged.
We acknowledge that AI can be useful, but we are convinced that human effort results in better and more relevant
contributions.

If you use AI to assist with your contribution, you are required to:

- Understand and verify any of its solutions.
    - If you don't understand the solution, do not submit it.
- Proofread and edit anything it generates.
    - Alternatively, it would be better to let AI proofread something you created *on your own*.
- Disclose how and how much you used AI for your contribution.
    - In particular, you must disclose if you used AI to write part of your contribution or issue/pull request description.
    - Using translation software for text that you originally wrote is acceptable for issues and pull requests.

As a rule of thumb, only submit code that you fully understand and are prepared to explain to a maintainer. Maintainers
are spending their personal time reviewing your code, it is your job to ensure that the code you submit is well-tested
and functional. Please be respectful of their time and only submit code that you have put thought and effort into.
Contributions made entirely by AI are prohibited.
