General rules and guidelines
============================

This page contains guidelines relevant for contributing to any area of Godot.

When contributing to any particular area, please refer to its respective guidelines additionally.

Code of conduct
---------------

When you contribute to Godot, we expect that you respect our `Code of Conduct <https://godotengine.org/code-of-conduct/>`__.

Contributing with AI and large language models
----------------------------------------------

The use of AI to contribute to Godot is discouraged.
We acknowledge that AI can be useful, but we are convinced that effort by humans results in better and more relevant
contributions.

If you use AI to assist with your contribution, you are required to:

- Understand and verify any of its solutions.
    - If you don't understand the solution, do not submit it.
- Proof read and edit anything it generates.
    - Better, use AI to proof read something *you* create.
- Disclose how and to what degree you used AI (in the issue description, pull request description, or otherwise).
    - In particular, you must disclose if you used AI to write part of your contribution or issue / pull request description. Using translation software for text that you originally wrote is acceptable for issues and pull requests.

As a rule of thumb, only submit code that you fully understand and are prepared to explain to a maintainer. Maintainers
are spending their personal time reviewing your code, it is your job to ensure that the code you submit is well-tested
and functional. Please be respectful of their time and only submit code that you have put thought and effort into.
Contributions made entirely by AI are prohibited.
