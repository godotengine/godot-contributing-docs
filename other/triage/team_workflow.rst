Team Triage Workflow
====================

Team Workflow
-------------

When issues arrive in the triage projects they will have the “For Team Assessment”
status. These issues should be treated as being unverified, and should be verified
before moving the issue to another status. This can be done as part of regular
team meetings, or be handled by individual maintainers processing these,
as long as the assessment made by triagers is verified.

As part of this verification, other information should be updated if needed.
For example, if the issue was added to multiple trackers because it was unclear
what area it belongs to, it should be removed from the unrelated tracker(s).
This is also a good time to verify any regression severity or assign one if it is
unassessed.

If the report is missing information, please ask the author for more details.
If the task of handling testing updated information can be handled by the bugsquad,
it be handed over to them for verification:
for example, testing an updated MRP provided by the author.
