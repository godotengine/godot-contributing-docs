Team Triage Workflow
====================

Team Workflow
-------------

When issues arrive in the triage projects they will have the “For Team
Assessment” status. These issues should be treated as being unverified,
and should be verified before moving the issue to another status. This
can be done as part of regular team meetings, or be handled by
individual maintainers processing these, as long as the assessment made
by triagers is verified.

As part of this verification, other information should be updated if
needed. For example, if the issue was added to multiple trackers because
it was unclear what area it belongs to, it should be removed from the
unrelated tracker(s). This is also a good time to verify any regression
severity or assign one if it is unassessed.

If the report is missing information, please ask the author for more
details. If the task of handling testing updated information can be
handled by the bugsquad, this task can be handed over to them for
verification: for example, testing an updated MRP provided by the
author.
