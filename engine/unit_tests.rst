Contributing unit tests
=======================

The Godot teams are dedicated to ensuring a reliable, bug-free experience for users.
Therefore, we expect important logic to be tested with unit tests.

Godot's unit tests are built into the binary, and can be run with an argument to the executable.
For more information, please read the
`current documentation for unit tests <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/engine_details/architecture/unit_testing.html>`_.

Unit test guidelines
--------------------

We do not have dedicated guidelines for unit testing as of yet.
Please use common best practices for writing unit tests when contributing to Godot.
