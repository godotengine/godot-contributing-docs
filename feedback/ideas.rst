Proposing and discussing ideas
==============================

We are always looking for suggestions about how to improve the engine. User feedback
is the main driving force behind our decision-making process, and limitations that
you might face while working on your project are a great data point for us when considering
engine enhancements.

If you have an idea, start by sharing and discussing it with our `community <https://godotengine.org/community/>`__.
There may be other, perhaps better, ways to achieve the desired result that community members
could suggest. And you can learn if other users experience the same issue, and figure out
a good solution together.

Once you gain a clear understanding of your idea, you can post a proposal.
Godot keeps track of ideas and proposals in the `godot-proposals repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals>`__.
The `readme file <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/blob/master/README.md>`__ explains the process
and has instructions to get started.

How are proposals accepted?
---------------------------

Proposals are formally accepted by adding them to a :ref:`triage project <doc_triage_projects>`
and marking them as ``Up for grabs``. You can see if this has happened by looking if a triage
project is listed on the right of the proposal page, under the word "Projects".
Maintainers may also make a comment on the proposal to say that the proposal is accepted,
and in which way it could be implemented.

A proposal being "accepted" means that any contributor (including you!) is free to
implement the proposed improvement, and submit it as a :ref:`pull request <doc_creating_pull_requests>`.
However, keep in mind that the proposal being accepted is not a guarantee that a PR will be accepted.

Note that most proposals are not formally accepted before being implemented, especially if they
are simple. This is usually not a problem, unless the proposal is complex or potentially controversial.
In this case, we recommend checking in with the responsible :ref:`teams <doc_areas>` before
starting work to implement something.

Evaluating proposals
--------------------

There are many ideas and proposals posted to Godot each day, which you can best browse by
using Godot's `proposal viewer <https://godot-proposals-viewer.github.io>`__.

Many proposals are not ready to be implemented just by the initial proposal alone.
Each proposal needs an evaluation of whether it is a common problem (through votes and
interest from the community), and a healthy amount of discussion to assess whether the
proposed solution is appropriate for the stated problem.

As a knowledgeable Godot user, you can help evaluate proposals by getting involved with the discussion.
Try to understand the proposal, critically evaluate whether the proposed solution is appropriate,
and iterate with the author to improve the proposal. Always stay respectful, but remember
that we have :ref:`guidelines for new features <doc_best_practices_for_engine_contributors>` and
don't always accept proposals just because they are popular. Factors to take into account when
evaluating proposals are listed at the bottom of the `readme file <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/blob/master/README.md#how-we-evaluate-proposals>`__.

If you agree with a problem but think a different solution approach would be more appropriate,
you can create a new proposal (with reference to the original one). This can be better than
simply commenting on the original proposal, as it gives the community room to discuss your
proposal on its own terms.

Proposal **discussions** especially often do not make a specific suggestion for improvement,
so if you are confident you understand the problem and have an idea for an appropriate solution,
feel free to open a proposal **issue** to formally propose it (with reference to the **discussion**).
